# Rearrange a collection of MP3s based on ID3 tag data

$ rearrange.py source dest
Scans source for files ending ".mp3" (case insensitive), attempts to read ID3
tag data from each MP3 found and if successful copies that MP3 to a new
directory in dest based on ID3 data: dest/artist/album/num_title.mp3.

In addition, most non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscore.
